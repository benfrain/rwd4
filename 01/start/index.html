                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>squeeze lemon juice (see Know-how below)</li>
                <li>beaten egg, to glaze</li>

        <div class="HowToMake">
            <h3 class="SubHeader">Method</h3>
            <ol class="MethodWrapper">
                <li>
                    Heat the oven to 220&deg;C (or gas mark 7). Tip the flour
                    into a large bowl along with the salt and baking powder,
                    then mix it all up. Add the butter in, then rub the butter
                    in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs.
                    When that is done, stir in the sugar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about
                    20-30 seconds. It should be warm but not hot. Add the
                    vanilla and lemon juice to the milk and then put that to one
                    side and but a baking tray in the oven to warm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine
                    it quickly with a cutlery knife – it will seem pretty wet at
                    first. Spread some flour onto the work surface and tip the
                    dough out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little
                    more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it's
                    smoother. Now pat it into a round shape about 4cm deep.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take a 5cm cutter (Pro-tip – smooth-edged cutters tend to
                    cut more cleanly, giving a better rise) and dip it into some
                    flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have
                    four scones. By this point you’ll probably need to press
                    what's left of the dough back into a round to cut out
                    another four.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Brush the tops with beaten egg, then place onto the hot
                    baking tray.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 10 minutes until risen and golden on the top. Eat
                    just warm or cold on the day of baking, generously (and I do
                    mean generously) topped with jam and clotted cream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If freezing, freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low
                    oven (about 160&deg;C) for a few minutes to refresh.
                </li>
