                            understanding of where Responsive Web Design came
                            from, the problems it solves and the core tenants of
                            implementing a Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and
                            CSS

                        <p class="rwd-Chapter_Content">
                            Good HTML markup is the basis for any good web site
                            or application. More importantly, HTML provides a
                            bedrock of understanding for assisitve technology.
                            In this chapter we cover everything from the opening

                        <p class="rwd-Chapter_Content">
                            Media queries provide the means to target CSS not
                            just on screen width, but screen height, color
                            preference, screen density (DPI) and a whole lot
                            more. Besides the media query deep-dive, this
                            chapter also covers responsive images; allowing you
                            to provide any number of image permutations based
                            upon the target device.

                        <p class="rwd-Chapter_Content">
                            Flexbox is the most widely supported modern CSS
                            layout system. Once we have covered the syntax and
                            use cases of Flexbox, we get our hands dirty with
                            Flexbox; using it to layout the markup of this very
                            site.

                            Repeating gradients? CSS filters like blur and

                            in here. Plus we will finish off by looking at CSS
                            scroll-snap; the fancy CSS ability to scroll

                            use-cases for SVG; how to insert SVGs directly into
                            markup, inside an object element, as a background
                            image and standard image. We also cover creating an
                            SVG sprite sheet, and how SVGs can be animated and
                            optimisied for use on the web.

                            In this chapter we cover all three. Once the syntax
                            and use-cases are covered we will use them
                            practically to create the various transitions,
